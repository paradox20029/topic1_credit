            <p>IoT Intelligent Applications are ready-made software-as-a-service (SaaS) programmes that can 
                examine and display IoT sensor data to corporate users via dashboards. IoT Intelligent 
                Applications are available in their entirety.Machine learning techniques are used by IoT apps 
                to analyse vast volumes of linked sensor data in the cloud. Key performance metrics, statistics 
                for mean time between failures, and other data are all visible through real-time IoT dashboards and notifications. 
                Machine learning-based algorithms are able to spot abnormalities in equipment, notify users, and even start automated 
                repairs or preventative steps.Business users who deploy cloud-based IoT apps can quickly improve the way that supply 
                chains, customer service, human resources, and financial services are currently run. Complete business processes don't 
                need to be redone.

            <p>
                People who use the internet of things can live and work more intelligently and have total control over their life. IoT is crucial to business in addition to providing smart home automation devices. With the help of IoT, organisations can see in real time 
                how their systems actually function, gaining insights into anything from equipment performance to supply chain and logistics activities.Businesses may automate procedures and save money on labour thanks to IoT. Additionally, it reduces waste, enhances 
                service delivery, lowers the cost of manufacturing and delivering items, and provides transparency into customer transactions.IoT is one of the most crucial technologies of modern life as a result, and it will continue to gain momentum as more firms 
                see its potential.

              <p>The fundamental ability needed for IoT is machine learning. You must have the ability to gather, examine, and glean insights from vast amounts of data. 
                To make predictions, you should be able to spot structures and patterns in the data you've been given.Artificial intelligence is also utilised for these 
                jobs and to make decisions based on algorithms, and its complexity is expanding.Every business needs engineers with IoT expertise that can gather data 
                from IoT devices and, simply put, make sense of it to boost productivity.

              <p>You need to have a solid foundation in programming if you want to pursue a career in the Internet of Things. You will come across as an expert in the 
                IoT industry if you are knowledgeable about programming languages like JavaScript and Python.Python assists programmers in creating and executing error-free code,
                 whereas JavaScript is a popular web-based scripting language and aids in creating a scalable and secure system at the backend.For creating IoT apps, Node.js is 
                 the most popular and preferred choice. IoT developers need to be proficient in using open source software environments.
                To control connected hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, these ecosystems require server-side web development.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <p>Real-time data is produced by IoT devices. An IoT engineer must be able to manage this type of data given how much data is generated on a daily basis. Data monitoring and analysis are done with big data.
                Because IoT applications are so complicated and scalable, there are many issues with IoT engineering, including privacy concerns, data loss, security, hostile assaults, etc.
                One of the main issues IoT engineers have is data storage. As was previously indicated, devices constantly produce enormous volumes of data.
                
                
                Cloud computing offers an easy and efficient solution to this problem. Could computing assist in hosting the excess data that each device has given that they are all connected to a network</p>
